                        <p><img class=left src=images/William_Adama.jpg alt=Admiral title="So say we all."/>Admiral William Adama, a veteran of the First Cylon War, is the commanding officer of the battlestar Galactica, and has the longest tenure as the highest ranking officer in the Colonial Fleet after the Fall of the Twelve Colonies.</p>
                        <p>Adama has the rare combination of qualities that make up a good leader: insight, the ability to naturally command respect, a common touch that enables him to relate to the enlisted personnel under his command as well as his officers, intuition, intelligence, a strong belief in his own abilities, and the ability to take the advice of others. These qualities are reflected in the fact that personnel of all ranks aboard Galactica hold him in high regard, and know that he is approachable.</p>

                         <h2>Kara "Starbuck" Thrace</h2>
                    </div>
					<p><img class=right src=images/Kara_Thrace.jpg alt=Starbuck />Kara "Starbuck" Thrace is a gifted Viper pilot, with an attitude that has hindered her career in the Colonial Fleet. However, William Adama has confidence in Thrace's military skills, and she greatly aids the Fleet inside and out of the cockpit. She is the last Commander, Air Group (CAG) of Galactica, and mysteriously vanishes in a region that will later be known as Tanzania on the second Earth shortly after the Fleet's arrival on the planet.</p>
					<p>Despite her tough, rebellious exterior, Thrace is deeply spiritual and possesses a great deal of faith in the Lords of Kobol. She usually prays in moments of mourning or desperation, such as when she thinks Lee is dead, when she is trapped on a desolate moon with a broken knee and low oxygen, and when she discovers she's in Cylon captivity. This spirituality is put to the test as a series of events lead her towards a mysterious destiny.

                		<p><img class=left src=images/Lee_Adama.jpg alt=Apollo />Leland Joseph Adama, commonly known as Lee Adama or by his callsign, "Apollo", is a former Colonial Fleet Reserve officer who becomes the Caprican delegate to the Quorum of Twelve, then later the interim President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. He is the sole surviving son of William Adama.</p>
                		<p>Lee Adama's relationship with his father had always been strained, culminating with a fracture after the death of his younger brother, Zak, two years before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies. Various attempts at reconciliation occur over the following years, but even these produce conflict as Lee attempts step outside his father's shadow.</p>

                <h2>About BSG</h2>
					<p><img class=cylon src=images/cylon.png alt=Cylon title="They have a plan" />Battlestar Galactica began as a four-hour miniseries pilot on the Sci Fi Channel in late 2003. As with the Original Series, the show begins with the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, but in a style more familiar and disturbing to today's viewers, making its events eerily reminiscent of feelings felt by many viewers to the sporadic and inconsistent news and chaos shown during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>

					<p>Some fans became pleasantly surprised of the quality of the miniseries and the regular series. Unlike its Original Series counterpart, the new series has not only survived to prepare for a fourth and final season in 2008, but has received many awards and nominations, including several Emmy nominations, a Peabody Award, a Saturn Award, and a Hugo Award. Its popularity has even given the show its own spin-off series, Caprica. In addition, the series has been sold to many other countries across the world.</p>
